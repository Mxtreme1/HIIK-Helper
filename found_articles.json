It has been firing into the villages of Thabawtseik, Pyingyi, and Kayingyi almost daily, according to a Launglon Township resident.\n\n He said to KIC: \u201cThe warship fire shells almost every day, seemingly targeting areas where resistance forces might be hiding. On some days, it has launched artillery barrages more than ten times. Many residents of coastal villages have already evacuated to other areas.\u201d\n\nThe shelling has forced more than 3,000 residents from the villages of Thabawtseik, Pyingyi, and Kayingyi to flee to other villages and areas around Launglon Town. Local resistance members have reported that the junta ship\u2019s shelling has damaged at least four houses in Pyingyi Village and injured two women.\n\nJunta bases in Launglon Township include Infantry Battalion (IB) 104, Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) bases 406 and 407 which all come under No. 18 Military Operations Command (MOC 18). They are currently reinforcing the bases in preparation for intensified military operations, according to Ko Shadow, a press officer for a people\u2019s defence force (PDF) unit in Launglon Township.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe junta is reinforcing its positions in Launglon. Although its troops haven\u2019t yet started military operations, they are making serious preparations.\u201d\n\nAccording to monthly reports from FE-5 Tanintharyi, a research organisation based in Tanintharyi Region, in July 2024 there were over 60,000 displaced people in the area of Launglon Township.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur."

        "paragraphs": "From 5 to 9 August, fierce fighting between the junta and resistance forces along with heavy artillery fire in the Zayatgyi area of Tantabin Township, where Kinmunchon Village is located, caused over 2,000 residents to flee to safer areas. The villages they fled from included: Kinmunchon, Doetan, PuKanKwe, NatYwar, HnitTantKu, and ThuHtayKone.\n\nDuring the fighting in the Zayatgyi area the junta closed the Zayatgyi to Kinmunchon road and commanded  the soldiers there to shoot and kill anyone they see who is not a junta soldier, including civilians.\n\nBecause the junta soldiers on the road were firing at anyone using the road, 200 villagers who were trying to flee Kinmunchon Village had to return to their homes. They are currently trapped in the village and unable to leave.\n\nA resident said to the Karen Information Center (KIC): \u201cGroups that returned to the village to gather supplies are now trapped. The military has set up checkpoints and imposed martial law with shoot-on-sight orders, making it impossible for them to leave. Major clashes are taking place around Kinmunchon and ShanSu villages, preventing any travel. Attempts to bring back [the people trapped in the village] are futile. While Zayatgyi town remains relatively calm, over 2,000 villagers from villages in the Zayatgyi area are fleeing.\u201d\n\nSince the beginning of August, residents from Doetan Village and nearby villages, also in the Zayatgyi area of Tantabin Township, had been sheltering from the fighting in nearby monasteries. On 9 August, heavy junta artillery fire killed three civilians people in the Zayatgyi area, according to local media reports. This prompted many people to flee from the monasteries, according to a local person.\n\nCurrently, there are more than 2,000 displaced people (IDPs) in and around the Zayatgyi area who urgently need food and basic supplies.\n\nA local organisation helping displaced people in the area warned people displaced from their villages, especially those from Kinmunchon Village, not to try to return home because of the fighting in the area.\n\nPreviously, In February 2024, there was fierce fighting between resistance forces and the junta in Zayatgyi area. During that time, the junta launched numerous airstrikes in the area causing significant civilian casualties and damage to properties.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur."

These lists contain detailed personal information, including names, fathers\u2019 names, and addresses of those set to be drafted. However, the number of people on the lists is so large that they can\u2019t capture everyone. Even though they have addresses, they don\u2019t know the exact locations of the houses where these individuals live. Some people have already fled after receiving advance notice.\u201d\n\nFollowing the junta\u2019s announcement, in February 2024,  that they were going to enforce the conscription law, the authorities have been conducting house-to-house searches for young people in the downtown wards of Kyaikto Town.\n\nAs a result, many youths temporarily fled their homes. Now that the situation has somewhat stabilised they have begun returning home and the soldiers have resumed searching for them.\n\nLocal media outlets reported at the end of May that the junta plans to abduct young men who are eligible for military service from their homes, whether or not they are on the conscription list, because the number of people who have been conscripted into the army from Mon State has not met the junta\u2019s expectations.\n\nIt is unclear how many locals have been arrested in these most recent conscription drives in Kyaikto Township.\n\nMost of the Mon State conscripts who could not avoid the draft have been sent to the Military Advanced Training Depot No. 4 (MATD-4) in Weakali Village, Thanbyuzayat Township, for military training. According to a report by the Burma Affairs and Conflict Study (BACS) about 400 men, were from Mon State were conscripted into the army in the first two conscription batches.\n\nOn 5 August the junta released photos approximately 150 newly conscripted men taking part in a ceremony at the beginning of their training at MATD \u2013 4. They were the fourth batch of conscripts from Mon State.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur."

CNF spokesperson, Salai Htet Ni, described the capture of the regional command headquarters, known as \u2018The Red Sun,\u2019 as a historic milestone.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe complete capture of a junta regional command headquarters marks a significant military milestone in the history of the ethnic armed resistance movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wholeheartedly congratulate them on this success, as it not only stands as a major achievement but also greatly inspires us to continue pursuing our political goals\u201d, he added.\n\nThe statement also said that The capture of the Regional Command headquarters will inspire other ethnic revolutionary organisations (EROs) in their fight against the junta and provide a great impetus to the push to overthrow them, according to the statement. Its signatories also pledged to fight authoritarianism and  continue their struggle until the junta is overthrown.\n\nThe junta has now lost control of nearly all of Lashio Town, including the regional command headquarters and only a few remnants of its forces are still in the town.\n\nJunta troops stationed at the central guard post and the military hospital inside the large Regional Command Headquarters compound, along with family members and injured personnel, gathered together, waved white flags and surrendered to the MNDAA, according to reports from the MNDAA/TNLA coalition.\n\nThis victory comes after more than a month\u2019s heavy fighting, following the resumption of Operation 1027 in northern Shan State on 25 June.\n\nDuring this second phase of Operation 1027 the ethnic resistance coalition captured key towns, including Nawnghkio (Naungcho) and Mongmit (Momeik) in northern Shan State, and Singu and Mogok towns in Mandalay Region. Combined forces of the TNLA and Mandalay People\u2019s Defence Force (PDF) also captured nearly three dozen bases and outposts in Madaya Township, Mandalay Region.\n\nThere had been previous reports that the Northeast Regional Command headquarters had fallen on 25 July, but those reports proved to be premature.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur."

There, he said that all the donated food, except for the noodles, belonged to him, according to someone who attended the meeting.\n\nThat person said: \u201cU Win Than claimed that the rice and oil were not provided by the state government but were his own possessions, and that the distribution of these items was merely for show.

Ko Aung San Oo was subsequently sentenced to 20 years in prison and Ko Myo Myint Oo received a life sentence.\n\nNeither of the men have the right to appeal their excessive sentences.\n\nDespite the journalists\u2019 right to appeal and receive a fair trial, there has been no detailed explanation of the legal reasons for their long prison sentences, and no opportunity to inquire about the judicial process.\n\nDawei Watch, a news outlet reporting on the Tanintharyi Region, which the two journalists were working for at the time of their arrests, issued a statement condemning their sentences saying they had not received a fair trial. It also called for their immediate release and condemned the junta\u2019s illegal detention and arbitrary sentencing of other journalists.\n\nNan Paw Gay, the Chairman of the Independent Press Council Myanmar (IPCM) said: \u201cArbitrarily arresting journalists and imposing severe sentences demonstrates a complete lack of judicial oversight. Journalists must be mindful that they are being targeted, whether or not they are in areas under martial law. It is also a threat to the remaining journalists.\u201d\n\nWhen Ko Myo Myint Oo and Ko Aung San Oo were arrested, Myeik was not under martial law.\n\nAccording to the Dawei Watch statement when the two journalists were arrested on charges related to their reporting the junta confiscated their phones and laptops and sent them to a military interrogation center, where they were beaten and interrogated for four days before being sent to Myeik Town Prison.\n\nKo Aung San Oo was sentenced to 20 years in prison on 16 February 2024, and Ko Myo Myint Oo was sentenced to life in prison on 15 May 2024.\n\nSince the February 2021 coup, more than ten domestic news media outlets have had their publishing licenses revoked by the junta. The arrest and imprisonment of journalists is a significant challenge to journalists trying to report freely and fairly on what is happening in Myanmar.\n\nCurrently, about 50 journalists remain imprisoned in Myanmar.\n\nDespite calls from international and domestic media groups for the junta to release all imprisoned journalists they remain in detention and the arrest of journalists continues.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur."

The Ngalaik Dam on Ngalaik Creek, in Pyinmana Township, in Naypyidaw Council Territory, and the Swar Dam on Swar Creek, in Swar (a.k.a.Hswar) Town, Yedashe Township, Bago Region.\n\n\n Over 5,000 people living in nearby villages and urban areas have been affected by the flooding, according to a woman helping rescue efforts in Taungoo Township. She also said that the flooding was not due to heavy rainfall and instead, happened because the junta had deliberately breached the two dams.\n\nA resident of Taungoo Township said to KIC: \u201cThe junta breached the Ngalaik and Swar dams. Without any rain, the water levels have risen significantly. The water has entered all the villages. Currently, it is affecting over 5,000 residents. Though this is the situation we have seen in eastern Taungoo Township, there has also been significant flooding in the western part of Taungoo Township. The water has affected all the towns and villages, damaging everything, including food supplies. Everyone is facing difficulties.\u201d\n\nWater levels are rising every day. Currently the floodwaters are at head-height, so residents in low lying areas are having to use tyre inner tubes and makeshift rafts to get around.\n\nWards 8,9 and 10 in the low-lying areas of Taungoo Town have been particularly badly affected by the flooding, as have villages on the bank of the Sittaung River, close to Taungoo Town.\n\nKo Kyaw Thura, a rescue worker said that local humanitarian organisations are helping flood-affected residents and relocating them to five temporary flood shelters set up in schools located on higher ground in the town.\n\nKo Kyaw Thura said: \u201c It has been like this for about three days. Initially, the focus was on rescue operations due to the rising water levels. Once temporary shelters were set up, primary support and essential supplies like food and clean water were provided. Recently, due to insufficient access to drinking water, some areas are experiencing cases of diarrhea and other health issues. Therefore, healthcare services are being provided to address these concerns.\u201d\n\nCurrently, about 2,500 people displaced from their homes by the flooding are staying at the five shelters in Taungoo Town. More temporary shelters have also been set up in monasteries in Taungoo Township villages.\n\nThe junta has supplied no aid or help and there has been no support from international organisations. Instead, the victims have been relying on donations from people inside Myanmar and from the Myanmar diaspora living abroad, which are being passed on to local humanitarian organisations and community groups who are assisting the flood victims, according to residents of affected areas.\n\nThe water level of the Sittaung River has continued to rise, meaning that even more people may become affected by flooding. According to residents, this is the worst flooding Taungoo Town has experienced in its history.\n\nThough it has not been confirmed, it is believed that the flooding has happened because the junta deliberately breached the two dams. The water levels started rising after the junta leader Min Aung Hlaing visited Taungoo Town on 23 August, suggesting that the junta breached the dams shortly after his visit.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur."

It is a significant inconvenience for us [drivers].\u201d\n\nKaren Information Center (KIC) attempted to contact representatives of the DKBA BGF and the KPC to ask them about their increased collaboration with the junta, but, so far, they have received no reply.\n\nThere has been daily fighting in Karen State between the junta and the anti-junta Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) supported by other allied resistance forces in places such as Payathonzu Town and the townships of Hpapun, Kawkareik, Kyainseikgyi, and Myawaddy.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur."

        "subheadline": "A local aid organization has reported a notable increase in diarrhea cases among displaced individuals in the Tanintharyi Region this month.",
        "paragraphs": "An official from the Nway Oo Myittar aid group informed KIC that areas hosting displaced people lack essential resources such as clean drinking water, food, and adequate sanitation, contributing to the surge in diarrhea outbreaks.\n\n \u201cWe are still assessing the exact circumstances of the outbreak. The combination of long-term refugees and recently displaced individuals poses challenges in implementing effective relief efforts. While current cases of diarrheal diseases have not yet reached cholera levels, they are most prevalent among adults over 20 years old,\u201d she noted.\n\nIn Tanintharyi Region, ongoing conflict in Dawei, Launglon, Thayetchaung, and Palaw townships has driven many residents to seek refuge in forested areas. Displaced individuals face difficulties accessing clean water and medical supplies due to restricted public access imposed by the junta. Furthermore, inadequate housefly-proof toilets in displacement camps are exacerbating the spread of diarrheal diseases, she added.\n\n\u201cThe number of diarrhea patients is estimated to be in the hundreds. The rainy season\u2019s damp conditions in forested areas, coupled with inadequate sanitation, appear to exacerbate the spread of diarrhea. At present, our medical resources are insufficient even to treat common cases of diarrhea,\u201d she expressed concern.\n\nDue to ongoing armed conflict in Tanintharyi Region, approximately 20000 long-term war refugees and nearly 40000 temporarily displaced individuals have been uprooted, totaling nearly 60000 displaced persons.\n\nAccording to local media reports, the number of diarrheal disease cases across Myanmar in July has risen to approximately 700, based on available statistics.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur."
